YunHome
=======

A device for displaying information used in home, e.g. Weather info, etc. 

This project requires two hardware: 
1. An Arduino Yun (http://arduino.cc/) as Controller. You can purchase it from their web site, or you can find the resellers from their web site. I purchased it from http://xidikaiyuanshuma.tmall.com/ in China.

2. A TFT touch screen shield from SeedStudio (http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/28-TFT-Touch-Shield-V20-p-1286.html) as screen. I also purchased from http://xidikaiyuanshuma.tmall.com/.

The installation of the hardware is quite easy, just plug the screen shield to the Arduino Yun. And using a micro USB cable to connect the Ardunio to your Computer.
